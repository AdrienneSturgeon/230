    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to create a web-based application that allowed teams of players to guess a computer generated image.
    
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    I was very thorough in evaluting the different operating systems that might be used for the application. I considered not just the business's needs
    but also the end user's experience as well.
    
    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    Understanding the needs of the client was extremely important in creating an excellent final product. The design document was pivital in understanding
    what the final needs of the client were so I could anticipate them throughout development.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    I would revise my operating systems analysis if given a second chance. I would try to better support my observations with reliable sources to give credence
    to the ideas I presented.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    I tried to be aware of what operating systems were most avilable to the end user when choosing a recommendation. When considering system memory and storage I also
    made recommendations that would give the end-user the smoothest expereince with as little downtime as possible. Understanding the user's needs can help ensure that
    the program is being developed to function with purpose rather than just focusing on the technical speifications.
    
    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    In the future, I would try to better understand what the client truly needed. We were able to give very general recommendations in this project, but I think
    being able to speak to the client and comprehensively understand their needs would help me develop the stratgies neccesary to meet them.
